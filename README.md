# CppLi6

CppLi6 is a Library of C++ that contains codes I write while I learn to code.

## Basic Structure of this Library

Every function will be in its own file and (hopefully) well commented. Thus this would probably be more of a tutorial thing than a really functional Library. It is functional tho.
<!--I'm still a noob, so I'm afraid of large files. Every file better be less than a hundred lines-->

## Some other stuff
This is the first time I commit on GitHub for real. And also the first time I write a Library or and sort. I want to be Thorough as possible and accurate. Hope I won't abandon this soon.
